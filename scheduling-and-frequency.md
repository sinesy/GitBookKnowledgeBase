# scheduling and frequency

The definition of a scheduled process includes scheduling and frequency. These two parameters are used to decide how often the process will run. Scheduling can have these values: MINUTES / DAILY / MONTHLY / END MONTH Frequency is a numeric input field.

## Example

* MINUTES 60 \(process will run every hour\)
* 10:30am -&gt; 11.30am -&gt; 12.30am -&gt; 1:30pm and so on.
* DAILY 5 : process will run every 5 day.
* 2016.01.01 -&gt; 2016.01.06 -&gt; 2016.01.11 and so on.
* MONTHLY 3 : process will run every 3 month.
* February -&gt;May -&gt; August and so on
* END MONTH: like MONTHLY, but the last day of month.
