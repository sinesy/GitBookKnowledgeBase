# How to auto-show a window from login

If you need to automatically open a window belonging to a Platform application, from an external client, after a successful login, you can use the optional request parameter **functionId**.

Please bear in mind that you cannot access to Platform windows without a successful authentication, so first you need to show to login window and pass to such a page the **funtionId** parameter \(or any other required parameter\). In case of a correct log-on, Platform will automatically show the specified window and pass forward the required parameters, that you have to pass in the initial URL too.

Example  of a login URL + auto show window + required parameters:

```text
https://host:port/platform/4ws/index_app.jsp?applicationId=...&functionId=<myfunctionid>&paramname1=<paramvalue1>&paramname2=...
```

where &lt;**myfunctionid**&gt; identifies the window to open and &lt;**paramname1&gt;**, &lt;**paramname2**&gt;  are the required window parameters, expressed in camel case.

&lt;myfunctionid&gt; value can be retrieved looking at the source code generated by Platform when opening the window \(it is the function name\) or can be guessed starting from the window title: it can be either the title in came case + spaces replaced by underscore \(e.g. "Confirmed Order" -&gt; function id = confirmed\_order\) or with the same rule and a get at the beginning \(e.g. "Managed Orders" -&gt; function id = getManagedOrders\). 

The window parameter names can be easily retrieved by open in the App Designer that window and look at the Input Parameter folder: you have just to convert such names in camel case.
