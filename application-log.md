# Application Log

If you want to view the application log you can use the “Administration –&gt; Application Log” functionality.

With this function, you can search the log messages generated on the server-side, using a few optional filters \(by date, by user, etc\).

When pressing Search, you can read the log messages on the grid and the filter panel collapses, to give you a larger area where reading the content.

To restore the filter panel, you can click on the black top bar or on the arrow.
