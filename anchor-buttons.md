# Anchor buttons

if you have a large window with many panels and you want to create links to see them quickly you may need to create anchors button.

1. Add a buttons panel in the window

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

2\. Select the panel you want to create a link and select the "Create anchor button" menu&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

3\. Now you can define the anchor button. Select the container for the anchor button; digit the label of button and select the container panel with the scroll.&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

4\. Now you have an anchor button in button panel&#x20;

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

5\. Now you can use the anchor button in the interpreted application.



You can customize the button action but you can't change the references of the link panel and the scrollable panel. This information must be the same as that of the style and refer to the panels present in the window. If you want change this references I suggest you to cancel the anchor and recreate it.

If necessary you can selected and javascript action to execute when the scroll activate the anchor button.
